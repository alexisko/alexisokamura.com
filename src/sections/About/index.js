          <p>Since I could hold a pencil I absolutely loved art.  As I grew older my passion for art translated into programming.  I use my eye for design and my obsessive attention to detail to create pixel-perfect interfaces.  More than anything I love being creative and get excited about being able to create products that will visually stun people.</p>
          <p>When Iâ€™m not hacking away at my computer Iâ€™m jumping on my next flight to see what else this world has to offer!</p>
          <p>Iâ€™m currently looking for full-time opportunities on the West Coast!  Feel free to <u><a href="mailto:alexiskokamura@gmail.com">email me</a></u> or take a look at my <u><a href={resume} target="_blank">resume</a></u>.</p>
